Memory Game - Interactive Frontend Project
======================================

Create a matching memory card game for children.

A dashboard with an even number of playing cards. Cards are flipped two at a time to make a matching pair. If the cards don't match they return to their initial state. Only when all cards are matched will the player win the game.

Game Requirements
-----------------------------------------
* Only two cards can be rotated per turn (these need to be two separate cards, one card selected twice does not count as a turn).
* If cards match then the cards stay rotated.
* If cards don't match then cards rotate to initial state.
* Need to be able to shuffle card positions on page reload/on clicking of game restart button.
* When player wins a modal box displays on screen congratulating the winner and giving them the option to replay the level, move onto next level or return to home screen.
