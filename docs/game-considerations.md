Considerations and Game Requirements
-----------------------------------------
**1. Design/Layout of the Game**

Using HTML & CSS create a game grid.

**2. Turning/Flipping the Cards**

Look at matched cards & what happens.

Look at unmatched cards & what happens.

Things to consider:
* Double clicking the same card
* Speed of the cards rotating
* Locking board when two cards have rotated to start new turn
* Matching cards stay rotated
* Unmatched cards rotate back to initial state

**3. Winning Game**

All cards are rotated displaying matching images.

This triggers a modal box to open and display congratulations message and buttons with option to return to the winning gameboard (by clicking (x)), play again button, move to next level where available or return to home screen.

**4. Shuffling Cards**

An ability to shuffle the positions of the cards is an integeral part of the game. Card positions should reshuffle on page load, if the restart button is clicked or the play again button is clicked.

**5. Counting player moves**

Count the number of moves a player makes and display moves on screen. Only when two cards have rotated will it be considered that a move has occurred.
